# Welcome
In this tutorial I followed the directions outlined by [Colt Steele]( https://www.linkedin.com/in/coltsteele/) in section 7 (Bootstrap) of the [The Web Developer Bootcamp]( https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/learn/v4/overview ) class.

# Why I Completed the Tutorial
With a history of backend development roles, I came to realize that to become a better engineer I needed to learn more about frontend development. To most individuals, the frontend is the product, and I was always nervous about sharing examples of my work publicly because of my limited frontend development skills. After hearing about [Brandon Morelli](https://github.com/bmorelli25/Become-A-Full-Stack-Web-Developer)'s experience, I decided that it was about time I learn more about frontend development.

# Overall Impression of this Tutorial
I enjoyed using Bootstrap to help create the grid layout for this website. I have continuously heard how positioning in frontend design is one of the most important aspects to nail and now I have a tool that will assist me in that endeavor. I canâ€™t wait for the next hackathon I compete in as I am sure this will help in the delivery of my project.
